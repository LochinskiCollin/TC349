Though their homepage is very long height, they make a joke at 
it. This makes me feel like they did it on purpose and not a 
design flaw. The color scheme of Chartbeat is very clean and 
has good tones. The contrast between the black words and light 
blue works well. Also they use a white font color on the backgrounds
of a dark hue. This gives the reader a different experience 
in every section. 

While scrolling we see many live images that catch your eye. These
help stop people from scrolling all the way down. The use of large 
fonts also grab readers attention. The lines between each section also
give a strong sense of content change. With each section making a valid
point in using their software.

Lastly to comment on, but I think is the best part, is the 
scrolling header. While we scroll, this header stays at the top
of the window. Though this is not the top of the page. This is the 
second bar down, but they chose to have this one because of its 
important link to TRY their product. With a big button and catch line,
it is hard to miss.
