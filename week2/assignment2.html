  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <br />
  <p>I am a Michigan State Senior in <a href="http://cas.msu.edu/programs/bachelors-in-media-and-information" title="Media and Information at MSU" target="_blank">Media and Information</a> looking to graduate this summer. I am currently working on developing my own website at <a href="http://lochinski.com" title="Lochinski.com" target="_blank">Lochinski.com</a>. I am still just learning the basics  but am looking forward to honing my skills.</p>
  <p>I want to begin an internship this summer with any IT department near East Lansing. I have found many companies employ a small full time staff  to run their IT. If I was to get this head start into the field, I think it would better my chances of finding a job right aftter graduation.</p>
  <p>When I came to MSU I wanted to be a computer engineer, but when I found out how much the technologies are moving to social sites and cloud services like <a href="http://facebook.com" title="Facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com" title="Google Drive" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>, I came to the Comm Arts and Sciences College to be part of the new wave of web developers.</p>

  <h1>Critique of <a href="http://panic.com" title="Panic Homepage" target="_blank">Panic.com</a></h1>
  <br />
  <p>This website offers a nice sleek look. With the awesome links to their well develop apps. The seamless growth of the buttons is eye catching and graps attenion. With their logo right at the center of the page it forces people to remember that iconic image instead of just the name "Panic".</p>
  <p>Their site also lacks in some basic points. One, they do not ahve a  basic colo scheme going through their entire site, so I can't tell if its there blue logo or the random red and purple stripes are the main theme. Second is the homepage is spread vertically down and the first thing a normal window size sees is split images. Also, the big links to their blog and t-shirts don't change when hovering over them. THis lets people go right over top of them without realizing they are links to other sites. And lastly, the dropbox at the bottom has too light of text that it borders on illegible. </p>
