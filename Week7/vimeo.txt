Vimeo.com is a online video streaming site that allows its 
users to view the entire library of videos. Their homepage is 
tailored to a new user. A large form box fills across the width
of the page, with the inputs of name, email, and password. 
Preexisting users have to click on login. If a non-member wants 
to browse the videos without signing up they can search in the
upper right of the menu bar.

This site uses a single column approach on the homepage with a
two column page on the search pages.Then goes back to a single 
column for the video streaming. The video appears at the top of 
the page, with the title and details underneath. This format is 
simple a sleek and lets the user view the actual content. 

The homepage also has an inviting background image to catch the 
user attention. With a solid color separating the important 
sections. I do believe they have too much on their homepage and it
requires the user to scroll a far ways down to hit the footer.

Overall I enjoyed this site and am an active member. They are a 
strong competitor to YouTube, and give a little more quality 
over quantity.
