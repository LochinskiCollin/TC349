A sleek design with a great combination of colors. Smooth lines that divide 
the page and the different content. I even noticed the fade in of the hover 
for links. The buttons to take you to the corresponding spot on the page was 
a great new way to navigate the site. The use of wire-framing was evident, 
with the box layout and dividing the content so it didn't look repetitive.

The flow of the homepage was outstanding, and I think that is why I did not 
like the rest of the other site pages. They seem to be just pops off the 
homepage, instead of being pages themselves. And it was a bit confusing 
which page would take you where, after you left the main site.

Though the page never seemed to end, with each new section I felt like I was
on a different page. The bottom of the home page and the footer wrap the site 
up nicely. Again nice clean lines with subtle colors to give the webpage a 
bright attitude but not overpowering. The social links could've been a bit 
bigger, it took some looking to find them.
