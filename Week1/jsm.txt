   I think Jason used website design elements very well. With a white background he eleimates people
who don't like the site because they dont like the color. Also he uses a strong contrast with his 
header and footer being black. The home logo that also allows for a link to the hompepage could be bigger
but his does not take away from the page.

   The content is nicely spread out with could natural lines through out the page. He uses the homepage as
a news feed for more recent updates on the whole site. With a navagation to take you to the blog archieve
and the books he has designed(I think). Though his portfoilo is not up he leaves a link to an older page
which allows users the option if they want. 

   I think his footer is very well done and fits a lot of information into a tight space perfectly. Links
to social media and a search bar all fit nicely next to a quick bio and sponsors.Overall I enjoyed this 
website and believe he is a very good graphic designer.
