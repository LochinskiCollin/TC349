   I decided to use Dreamweaver for my text editor and Git Bash for my shell. This 
plus using Google Chrome to access GitHub.com allows me to work off my PC 
naturally. I can see both the shell and Github with Windows 7 Side-by-side view, 
and with Dreamweaver's split Code/Design view, making html and css files is easy.
I think this will be the best App Environment for me in this class.

   With these easy programs I am able to see all my work being done simintaniously 
across many platforms. This allows me to work continuely through my design without 
stoping to backup and uplaod copies. Saving time and the hassle of looking for the
copy if I make an error.
