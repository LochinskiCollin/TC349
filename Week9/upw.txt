United Pixel Workers have a great interactive website that shows the power of new scripting. I would believe
they are using javascript or a form like jquery to get the instant affects you can see all over their site.
Even before I moved my mouse after the page loaded, the webpage was already raising the unit the mouse was
hovering on. This was impressive at first and mind-blowing when I scrolled over the home icon and shopping
cart icon. The transition was seamless and hovering on links was like never before. The smooth change of 
status was not a jump but a gradual transformation that flowed with the mouse on the page. 

The color scheme was very pleasing and the use of blocks to divide the page was very good and not over 
whelming. When looking at the footer I noticed a change in flow of the links. And the newsletter has already 
been plugged in the middle of the page. I did not see a reason to reiterate it again. The size of margins was 
also a concern for me, that they were too small. Until I resized my window to test what would be cut off and 
got my mind blown again. The whole page was dynamic with each block section reforming to the size. Also, 
the blocks would move to their position instead of popping there.
