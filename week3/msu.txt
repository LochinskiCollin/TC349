Critique of MSU.edu Homepage

I think the MSU Homepage is a simple look at a University’s home webpage. It lays out the basic link to the
rest of the site and allows new time users to navigate very easily. Though it may look simple I believe
the code is very precise and in-depth. With the header constant over all pages, it makes sure the user knows
they are still on the MSU site. The header includes a clickable logo (back to the homepage), a search bar to 
search the entire site for keywords, a header tab bar to go to different departments of the site, and finally
a small inline link list that gives the viewer a choice of user type(customizing the page to their needs). 


The best part of the site lies in the dropdown header tab bar. This gives a nice smooth option for the user
to pick which internal page they are looking for. After the header is the content and on the homepage it is 
mostly just news about the University. This content is well organized with clearly defined text boxes. The 
right sidebar gives a navigation choice to similar pages the viewer is on. All this adds up to a clean, 
easy to use webpage. 5 Stars.
