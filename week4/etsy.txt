Etsy is a simplistic view on a craft e-commerce site. With its off white background 
and grey padding boxes, Esty provides a clean and crisp look while the user shops. 
An easy header bar gives the user a search box for products and an easy sign-in or 
sign-up choice. Their use of a vertical navigation is slightly old style but works 
for the caterogory choices. There is no side bar on the right, which is very 
surprising not to see advertisments lining my page. 

The CSS for the page must be very simple for the header and navagation, where the main 
content on the homepage is randomized every visit. This is a difficult thing to pull off
without the proper math to make sure products aren't duplicated or along the same lines. 
The structure of this page is very well thought out and offers a pleasent view into the 
online shopping world.
