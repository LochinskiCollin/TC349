msu moblie site

The MSU mobile site looks like it has been thought over for a long time. It has
a nice flow to it with great navigation. The icons used are clear meaning and 
easy to see. The search bar does take up a lot of my screen but for typing, it 
is a necessary evil. The icon links lead you to the separate pages that allow
you to surf the site as much as the desktop version. With the only downfall that 
I can see is the lack of a full color scheme. Yes we bleed green and white but 
we don't have to stare at it all day. 

The next level down of pages all seem to use the same navigation list to continue
you on to the next level of categories. This shows uniformity and structure. When
people venture off the mobile site it is a clear distinction of the action. The MSU
 mobile site is great the way it is but could use a couple of tweaks to make it 
even better.
