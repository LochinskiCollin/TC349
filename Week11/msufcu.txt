The MSUFCU has done a very good job at creating a deicated mobile site for smaller devices. 
As of today there are three different versions of teh mobile site impletemented. At the 
bottom of the "new" mobile site there is the options of "classic mobile" and "full" site. 

Obviously the "full" site leads to teh desktop verison of the hompage in a condense noncomprehesive 
view. This is a bad way to view on a small handheld but would not be so bad on a larger tablet. 
Next I looked at the "classic" mobile site. This is a very basic static mobile site. Though it is 
the native scrren size with ledgable text, it just does not scream professional. With hyperlinks 
and just static text to fill teh page, this does not offer much. Luckly they recently published
their "new" moblie site. THis new view is interactive with form inputs for login, clearly defined 
buttons, and I would say the best thing that has no actual function, when you click a button to go 
to another page, the screen wipes off to the left as the new page comes in from the right. This 
subtle movement makes the experience more enjoable and smoother. It even has great logo images to 
clearly identify what company page you are on.Overall I think they learned through each step how 
to make a better experince for the users. And came out with something that people would be happy 
to use instead of their mobile app.
